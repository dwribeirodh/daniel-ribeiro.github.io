<hr>
<h1> Quick Overview </h1>
<p>My name is Daniel Ribeiro. I'm a senior (last semester) studying
chemical engineering at the University of Minnesota. I created this website as
an exercise for me to learn HTML and CSS and also just to show some of my previous work!
Thanks for stopping by!!</p>

<h1> Research Interests </h1>
<p>I am interested in computational science and I've done resesarch in that area for two-ish years now.
I have worked on constructing Laplacian pyramids, Monte Carlo simulations, compression etc.</p>

<h1> Chemical Engineering </h1>
<p>In chemical engineering, I am very interested in the areas of process design and controls.
I really liked control theory and it's definitely an area of study/work I would like to get
more experience with.</p>

<h1> Coding Languages </h1>
<p>I code in Julia, Python, Matlab very comfortably, and I know Java and could pick it up
after some careful review of syntax. Still not great with HTML (clearly haha).</p>

<h1> Projects </h1>
<p>Some projects I've worked on/currently working on:</p>
