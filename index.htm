<h1 style="text-align:center;">Welcome to Daniel's First Website</h1>
<hr>
<p>I'm learning HTML and while I do so I will try to post some cool things I have been working on. For this first version of the website
I wanted to include two gifs of some work I've done in computational physics with the annealing of the Ising model.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;">Wolff Algorithm Convergence</h2>
<p>
The gifs below show the converging behavior of the 2D Ising model with periodic boundary conditions via simulation using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolff_algorithm">Wolff algorithm</a>.
The animation on the left depicts the convergence of the magnetization of the system, while the animation on the right
depicts the convergence of internal energy. Both thermodynamic quantities are normalized by the total number of spins in the system. All simulations were coded using the <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia language</a>.
Source code will be made available shortly, stay tuned!!</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
    <img src="wolff_mag.gif" style="width:100%">
  </div>
  <div class="column">
    <img src="wolff_energy.gif" style="width:100%">
  </div>
</div>

<p style="text-align:left;"> Going into a little bit of detail on the animations, the left side of is a representation of the 2D Ising lattice, comprised of binary spins that take value -1 or 1. The percentage number is the ratio of
number of spin flips to the total number of spin flips being used as a parameter of the simulation. The large number above the graph is the real-time update of the number of spins that have been flipped during
the simulation. Lastly, the orange line represents the equilibrium solution for that particular temperature. </p>
